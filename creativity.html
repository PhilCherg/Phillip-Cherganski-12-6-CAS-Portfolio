				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Introductions</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">November 20, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Here begins this year's journey of the STEM Robotics Club at ACS. Being the lector of the club, I introduced 
				the new members to the club’s goals and tools.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Figuring out how to best explain key topics, such as the basics of 3D-modelling, programming in Python, and 
				working with the various equipment we had at our disposal in SCIFI, was a creative endeavor in its own right. It was fun coming 
				up with different ways of conveying my skills and experience in the field to newcomers in a way that was informative, but also easy
				to understand and engaging. I decided that the best course of action would be to complete the same tasks as the students. This would
				not only give me a better understanding of their point of view, but also allow me to create my own model in the process.</p>
				<p class="text-left">I started by brainstorming ideas for a project with the students. After everyone settled on creating a 3D-printed
				car, I asked them for design ideas, so that I could get some inspiration, but also to grasp their level of creativity and abilities. 
				After some extensive brainstorming, it was time for me to get to work designing my own prototype.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">STEM Robotics Club Model Design and 3D-Printing</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">December 4, 2020</h4>
				<p class="text-right">After all the students at the club decided on designing, printing, and programming a 3D-printed car, it was time
				for me to teach them how to effectively use SketchUp. Apart from showing them how to use SketchUp to create their own models, which I 
				focus on in the Service section of this portfolio, I also decided to design my own prototype. This was a creative way for me to refresh
				my own SketchUp skills, and it also allowed me to create a robot car myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">I brainstormed a couple of ideas, made a few test sketches, and eventually ended up with a prototype chassis. After
				all the designing was done, I 3D-printed it at SCIFI. I experimented with various options, such as print precision and density, to test 
				the stability of the model, since ensuring the chassis’ integrity of the car is essential for producing a working model that does not 
				easily break when exposed to tension, such as ground friction or the rotating motors.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Programming in Python</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">December 10, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Designing the model in SketchUp was not such a lengthy process, and it took me a couple of days to complete. However, 
				printing 5 different models with various combinations of precision and density took more time. Since the prints took around 7 hours to 
				finish, I would just start them when I got to school and pick them up at the end of the day.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Then, I equipped the best model with the necessary hardware. There were some Arduino sets at our disposal, which 
				include a motherboard, motors, wheels, etc. I put all of them together and tested them out. I decided to install all the wiring last, 
				since having connected cables all over the place made moving parts and changing the layout very hard.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Finally, I started programming the robot using Python. This was a new experience, since I had previously only 
				programmed LEGO Mindstorms sets using Python. Connecting the Arduino set and figuring out how to control it was a cool challenge for 
				me to overtake. It took some time and research online, but at the end, I got it all working.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Piano Lessons at Home</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">WHAT DATE TO PUT HERE?</h4>
				<p class="text-right">I have been playing the piano ever since I was a little kid. I started out with an organized plan, where 
				I followed a textbook of simple practice piano pieces to learn the keys and develop my technique. This went on for a while, and 
				I was able to learn to play realtively well beginner and intermediate pieces. However, I didn't feel like most of the pieces resonated 
				with me, since most of them were created for training purposes and not to sound melodically exceptional.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Then, when I got admitted to ACS, I had a period without piano lessons, since my previous teacher got a child. 
				I kept practicing on my own, and I even signed up for the ACS Instrumental Studio in my Prep year. Not long after, I met my current 
				teacher, and I have been having lessons with him at home ever since. </p>
				<p class="text-right">He has a significantly different approach. Whenever we are about to start a new piece, we discuss various styles 
				that would be of interest of me and he gives me some ideas of pieces to listen to. I feel like because of this, I have been learning to 
				play pieces that sound amazing, and I enjoy playing them more for that reason. </p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Winter Concert "The Dark Knight"</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">WHAT DATE TO PUT HERE?</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Throughout the years, I have learnt to play a number of classical and contemporary pieces. My teachers holds the 
				tradition of organizing winter and summer concerts, where all of his students can show of what they have been working on. Those are 
				really great events, since you get to play in fornt of an audience, without having too much stress.</p>
				<p class="text-left">For this year's winter concert, I had prepared a piece called "The Dark Knight," which is a 10-minute collection 
				of all the major themes of the movie "Batman: The Dark Knight." I really enjoyed learning and playing this piece in my free time, 
				since it sounds epic from start to finish.</p>
				<p class="text-left">The concert was a great success for me. Everyone enjoyed my performance of "The Dark Knight." Throughout the years, 
				I have come to know some of the students' parents. They have been observing my progress and always feel very impressed by my performances. 
				Having this appreciation from someone outside your family is a really refreshing and motivating feeling.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">ACS Classical Concert</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">December 10, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-right">I have been part of the ACS Instrumental studio since I was in my Prep year. Each year, I practice at school and prepare 
				a classical piece for the annual ASC Classical Concert. Being able to practice at school and get feedback and tutoring from someone different 
				than my regular teacher is really useful, since I get a taste of different teaching styles and receive additional tips.</p>
				<p class="text-right">This year, I had a hard time coming up with a piece to perform at the Classical Concert. Since I am a Senior, I wanted 
				to perform something memorable for my last ever ASC Classical Concert. After some brainstorming with my piano teacher, I decided to play 
				"O Fortuna" by Carl Orff. It is both well-known classical piece and it sounds extremely epic, so it was sure to attract the attention 
				of the audience and leave everyone impressed.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Learning the piece was a very enjoyable process, since I liked playing it often in my freetime, purely because of 
				how epic and energizing it sounded. I feel like I am fully ready with it now. However, due to the flu vacation, the Auditions and probably 
				the entire concert will be cancelled. While this is a bummer, I am still practicing "O Fortuna" from time to time, both to refresh my abilities 
				to play it, and also to brighten my mood.</p>
