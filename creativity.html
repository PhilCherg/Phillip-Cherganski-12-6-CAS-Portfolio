			<h2>Robotics, piano, websites, and more...</h2>
			<p class="sectionReflection">Major creative experiences in my senior year have been designing and programming a 3D-printed robot car, playing the piano, 
			and performing at Concerts. While I primarily focus on these in my portfolio entries below, I have also created a mobile game using Unity and a checklist 
			web service using C# and ASP.NET. Overall, I have improved my designing, programming, and piano skills as a result of my creative 
			efforts this year.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Introductions</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">Semester 1, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Here begins this year's journey of the STEM Robotics Club at ACS. Being the lector of the club, I introduced 
				the new members to the club’s goals and tools.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Figuring out how to best explain key topics, such as the basics of 3D-modelling, programming in Python, and 
				working with the various equipment we had at our disposal in SCIFI, was a creative endeavor in its own right. It was fun coming 
				up with different ways of conveying my skills and experience in the field to newcomers in a way that was informative, but also easy
				to understand and engaging. I decided that the best course of action would be to complete the same tasks as the students. This would
				not only give me a better understanding of their point of view, but also allow me to create my own model in the process.</p>
				<p class="text-left">I started by brainstorming ideas for a project with the students. After everyone settled on creating a 3D-printed
				car, I asked them for design ideas, so that I could get some inspiration, but also to grasp their level of creativity and abilities. 
				Following some extensive brainstorming, it was time for me to get to work designing my own prototype.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">STEM Robotics Club Model Design and 3D-Printing</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">December 4, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-right">After all the students at the club decided on designing, printing, and programming a 3D-printed car, it was time
				for me to teach them how to effectively use SketchUp. Apart from showing them how to use SketchUp to create their own models, which I 
				focus on in the Service section of this portfolio, I also decided to design my own prototype. This was a creative way for me to refresh
				my own SketchUp skills, and it also allowed me to create a robot car myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">I brainstormed a couple of ideas, made a few test sketches, and eventually ended up with a prototype chassis. After
				all the designing was done, I 3D-printed it in SCIFI. I experimented with various options, such as print precision and density, to test 
				the stability of the model, since ensuring the chassis’ integrity of the car is essential for producing a working model that does not 
				easily break when exposed to tension, such as ground friction or the rotating motors.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Programming in Python</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">December 11, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Designing the model in SketchUp was not such a lengthy process, and it took me a couple of days to complete. However, 
				printing 5 different models with various combinations of precision and density took more time. Since the prints took around 7 hours to 
				finish, I would just start them when I got to school and pick them up at the end of the day.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Then, I equipped the best model with the necessary hardware. There were some Arduino sets at our disposal, which 
				included a motherboard, motors, wheels, etc. I put all of them together and tested them out. I decided to install all the wiring last, 
				since having connected cables all over the place would make moving parts and changing the layout very hard.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Finally, I started programming the robot using Python. This was a new experience, since I had previously only 
				programmed LEGO Mindstorms sets using Python. Connecting the Arduino set and figuring out how to control it was a cool challenge for 
				me to overtake. It took some time and research online, but at the end, I got it all working.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Piano Lessons</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">2 hours a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">I have been playing the piano for 8 years now. I started out with an organized plan, where I followed a textbook 
				of simple practice piano pieces to learn the keys and develop my technique. This went on for a while, and I was able to learn to play 
				beginner and intermediate pieces relatively well. However, I didn't feel like most of the pieces resonated with me, since they  
				were written for training purposes and not to sound melodically exceptional.</p>
				<p class="text-right">At ACS, I signed up for the ACS Instrumental Studio in my Prep year. Not long after, I started working with a new 
				musical coach, and I have been having piano lessons for 2 hours each week ever since.</p>
				<p class="text-right">The current approach is significantly different than the one before. It is professional yet relaxed. Whenever we 
				are about to start a new piece, we discuss various styles that would be of interest to me. We listen to some classical and contemporary 
				pieces, and I chose the ones I like. I have been learning to play music that sounds amazing, and I enjoy my piano lessons very much.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Christmas Concert "The Dark Knight"</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">December 15, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Throughout the years, I have learnt to play a number of classical and contemporary pieces. My teacher holds the 
				tradition of organizing Christmas and summer concerts, where all of his students can perform in front of their parents, family, and 
				friends what they have been working on during the year. Those are really great events, since you get to play in front of a familiar 
				audience, without having too much stress.</p>
				<p class="text-left">For this year's Christmas concert, I had been practicing a piece called "The Dark Knight," which is a 10-minute 
				collection of all the major themes of the movie "Batman: The Dark Knight," written by the composer Hans Zimmer. I really enjoyed learning and 
				playing this piece in my free time, since it sounds epic from start to finish.</p>
				<p class="text-left">The concert was a great success for me. Everyone enjoyed my performance of "The Dark Knight." Throughout the years, 
				I have come to know some of the students' parents. They have been observing my progress and always feel very impressed by my performances. 
				Having this appreciation from someone outside my immediate family is a really refreshing and motivating feeling.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">ACS Classical Concert</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">March 25, 2020 (Cancelled)</h4>
				<p class="text-right">I have been part of the ACS Instrumental studio since my Prep year. Each week, I practice at school and learn to play 
				a classical piece for the annual ASC Classical Concert. Being able to practice at school and get feedback and tutoring from yet another teacher 
				is really useful, since I get a taste of a different teaching style and receive additional advice and assistance.</p>
				<p class="text-right">This year, I had a hard time coming up with a piece to perform at the Classical Concert. Since I am a Senior, I wanted 
				to perform something memorable for my last ever ASC Classical Concert. After some brainstorming with my piano teacher, I decided to play 
				"O Fortuna" by Carl Orff. It is both a well-known classical piece, and it also sounds grand, so it was sure to attract the attention of 
				the audience and leave everyone impressed.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Learning the piece was a very enjoyable process, since I liked playing it often in my free time, purely because of how 
				epic it sounded. I feel like I have mastered it by now. However, due to the flu vacation, the Auditions and the concert have been cancelled.
				While this is a bummer, I am still practicing "O Fortuna" from time to time, both to refresh my abilities, and also to brighten my mood.</p>
