				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Introductions</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">November 20, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Here begins this year's journey of the STEM Robotics Club at ACS. Being the lector of the club, I introduced 
				the new members to the club’s goals and tools.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Figuring out how to best explain key topics, such as the basics of 3D-modelling, programming in Python, and 
				working with the various equipment we had at our disposal in SCIFI, was a creative endeavor in its own right. It was fun coming 
				up with different ways of conveying my skills and experience in the field to newcomers in a way that was informative, but also easy
				to understand and engaging. I decided that the best course of action would be to complete the same tasks as the students. This would
				not only give me a better understanding of their point of view, but also allow me to create my own model in the process.</p>
				<p class="text-left">I started by brainstorming ideas for a project with the students. After everyone settled on creating a 3D-printed
				car, I asked them for design ideas, so that I could get some inspiration, but also to grasp their level of creativity and abilities. 
				After some extensive brainstorming, it was time for me to get to work designing my own prototype.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">STEM Robotics Club Model Design and 3D-Printing</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">December 4, 2020</h4>
				<p class="text-right">After all the students at the club decided on designing, printing, and programming a 3D-printed car, it was time
				for me to teach them how to effectively use SketchUp. Apart from showing them how to use SketchUp to create their own models, which I 
				focus on in the Service section of this portfolio, I also decided to design my own prototype. This was a creative way for me to refresh
				my own SketchUp skills, and it also allowed me to create a robot car myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">I brainstormed a couple of ideas, made a few test sketches, and eventually ended up with a prototype chassis. After
				all the designing was done, I 3D-printed it at SCIFI. I experimented with various options, such as print precision and density, to test 
				the stability of the model, since ensuring the chassis’ integrity of the car is essential for producing a working model that does not 
				easily break when exposed to tension, such as ground friction or the rotating motors.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">STEM Robotics Club Programming in Python</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left">December 10, 2019</h4>
				<p class="text-left">Designing the model in SketchUp was not such a lengthy process, and it took me a couple of days to complete. However, 
				printing 5 different models with various combinations of precision and density took more time. Since the prints took around 7 hours to 
				finish, I would just start them when I got to school and pick them up at the end of the day.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Then, I equipped the best model with the necessary hardware. There were some Arduino sets at our disposal, which 
				include a motherboard, motors, wheels, etc. I put all of them together and tested them out. I decided to install all the wiring last, 
				since having connected cables all over the place made moving parts and changing the layout very hard.</p>
				<p class="text-left">Finally, I started programming the robot using Python. This was a new experience, since I had previously only 
				programmed LEGO Mindstorms sets using Python. Connecting the Arduino set and figuring out how to control it was a cool challenge for 
				me to overtake. It took some time and research online, but at the end, I got it all working.</p>
