			<p>Hello! My name is Phillip Cherganski. I am 17 years old, and I am currently in my senior at ASC. My hobbies range
			from playing computer games with my friends and solving puzzles with my family to playing tennis, swimming, and playing the piano.
			I have always been interested in Math and Programming.</p>
			<p>My current carreer goal is to become a freelance programmer, since that would
			give me the freedom of managing my own worktime while doing the things I love most.</p>
			<p>This website will guide you through all the various CAS activities I have done during my senior year at ASC.
			It is divided in three sections - Creativiy, Activity, and Service - each containing their respective evidence and reflection.</p>
