				<h3 class="text-left">Tennis Court Training</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">DATE???</h4>
				<p class="text-left">I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old. I started out in a tennis club near home called "DEMA Tennis Club."
				At first, I trained in a beginner group with 4 or 5 other kids. I learnt how to hold the racket, how to perform the basic hits properly, 
				and how to move around the field effectively.</p>
				<p class="text-left">As I got better and better, however, I realized that training in a group was not efficient, since I had to wait for my turn 
				to hit the ball. Additionally, the trainer's attention was naturally divided between all kids, so he could not give as much individual attention 
				to everyone and point out small mistakes.</p>
				<p class="text-left">This is why I started having individual lessons with a private coach. Not only do I get to play more, I also receive more feedback, 
				so I improve more. Additionally, I can play against my coach to simulate a real game, which is always fun. Not only have I learnt more advanced 
				hits, such as slices and backline smashes, I have also improved my serve and my all-around movement and decision-making.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Tennis Court Serving</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">DATE???</h4>
				<p class="text-right">Something that I have always struggled with is serving. Whenever I played against my previous coaches, we always simualted 
				a match but without the serves. Of course, this was easier for me, since I didn't have to worry about scoring a good serve or defending against my 
				coach's serve. However, this year I realized that this was actually a major drawback and it hurt my game a lot.</p>
				<p class="text-right">This is why I decided to focus on my serving this year. Every week, I would only practice serving the last 15 minutes of the 
				training session. My coach would stand next to me and guide me, correcting my grip, movement, ball toss, and timing. I found this really helpful, 
				and in no time, I was able to perform relatively good serves.</p>
				<p class="text-right">After I was confident enough in my serving abilities, it was time for me to put them to test. I told my coach that I wanted to 
				try playing simulated games with serves. At first, I felt like most of my games were lost due to double faults, and that my only real cahnce of winning 
				a game was on my coach's serve. However, as I practiced more and more, I started to get more serves in, and now I am consistently winning my games.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Going swimming</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">????</h4>
				<p class="text-left">My passion for swimming was born when my parents introduced me to a friend of theirs, who was a swimming coach, when I was 5 years old.
				I started going swimming, and he taught me the basics of controlling your body in water, correct breathing, as well as the basic crawl and breaststroke. 
				This event changed my life, since being able to swim gave me the confidence to enter deep pools during hotel vacations or play in the sea when the waves are 
				high.</p>
				<p class="text-left">At some point, I stopped having swimming lessons, since I felt there weren't many more new things for me to learn. I did, however, continue 
				going swimming by myself or with my dad. I have been doing it this year, as well. I feel like going swimming once a week with my dad is a great way for 
				me to maintain my physical form, as well as to spend quality time with my father. </p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Swimming Challenges</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">?????</h4>
				<p class="text-right">This year, I have been going swimming for two hours with my dad each week. We go to a 25m pool located in the Sportna Palata in Sofia. 
				Throughout the year, I developed my own swimming plan, aimed at improving my stamina and technique. My goal was to gradually increase the number of laps 
				I swam each time, so that I could seemlessly become more durable.</p>
				<p class="text-right">For the most part, my plan consists of a mixture of the crawl, breaststroke, and backstroke techniques. When I staerted, I would swim 10 
				laps each, for a total of 30 laps or a 750 meters. I found it hard to keep going after that, but I made sure I always tried to swim a couple more, 
				to see how far I could push myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Now, after a whole year of training, I am easily able to swim 20 laps of each technique, for a total of 60 laps or 1.5 kilometers. 
				Keeping in mind that we swim for 2 hours at a time, I am quite happy with my progress and current results. I have noticed that I take shorter and 
				less frequent breaks, and that my limiting factor has become the time we spend there, instead of the energy I have left.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Riding a Bike to School</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">?????</h4>
				<p class="text-left">One of the best parts about ACS is that it is very close to where I live. This is why ever since 8th grade, I have been going 
				to school by bike whenever the weather allows it. I feel like this has allowed me to exercise more and stay energized the whole day. </p>
				<p class="text-left">I have been able to go to school by bike in the fall and spring largely because of the bike parking railings at school. Even 
				though my previous school was close to home as well, I never went to school by bike, simply because there was no safe location for me to leave my bike. 
				Having the opportunity to lock my bike near Abbott without having to worry about its safety is really amazing.</p>
				<p class="text-left">A great perk of going to school by bike is that I could easily meet with friends in the neighborhood directly, instead of having to 
				go home to take my bike. Often times, I would make arrangements with friends outside of ACS to go see a movie or go ride bikes in the Business Park. This is 
				why, in a sense, riding a bike to school has improved my social life as well.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Going hiking with my Family</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">?????</h4>
				<p class="text-right">My mother and father have the tradition of going hiking in Vitosha every Sunday. They discover different routes each time and try 
				to change their path now and then to keep things fresh. This year, I decided to join them on their weekly mountain hike, even though walking long distances 
				is not something I necessarily love.</p>
				<p class="text-right">At the beginning, it was hard for me to walk the same distance my family had been used to walk form some years. I always felt tired 
				halfway through the trek, and I felt it was funny how a young person like me would tire more quickly than people my parents' age.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Even though I felt tired, my legs hurt, and my breathing was heavy, I endured and kept going with my family on their weekly hikes. 
				Now, I feel like I am able to successfuly finish all treks without really feeling tired at all. I am really proud of my progress, since now I am finally 
				able to keep up with my sporty parents and show them that I can be active as well.</p>
