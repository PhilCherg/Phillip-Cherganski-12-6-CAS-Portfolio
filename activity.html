				<h3 class="text-left">Tennis Court Training</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">Twice a week</h4>
				<p class="text-left">I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old. I started training at DEMA Tennis Club in Sofia. At first, I trained in a beginner 
				group with 4 or 5 other kids. I learnt how to hold the racket, perform the basic hits properly, and move around the field.</p>
				<p class="text-left">As I got better, I started training individually with a personal trainer. Not only did I get to play more, compared to training 
				in a group, when I had to wait for my turn to hit the ball, but I also received more feedback, allowing me to improve quicker. Additionally, when 
				training, my coach and I simulate a real game, which is always fun, but I also get all my small mistakes pointed out at once. I have learnt more 
				advanced hits, such as slices and backline smashes, and I have also improved my serve and my all-around movement and decision-making.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Tennis Court Serving</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">Twice a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">Serving is something that I have always struggled with. Before, whenever I trained and played games with my coach, we would 
				always simulate a match without the serves. Of course, this was easier for me, since I didn't have to worry about scoring a good serve or defending 
				against my coach's serve. However, this was actually a major drawback, and it hurt my game substantially.</p>
				<p class="text-right">This is why I decided to focus on my serving this year. Every week, I would practice serving for 30 minutes at the end of each 
				training session. My coach would guide me, correcting my grip, movement, ball toss, and timing. I found this really helpful, and in no time, I was 
				able now to perform relatively good serves.</p>
				<p class="text-right">As I am somewhat confident enough in my serving abilities, I am putting them to the test each time I train. My coach and I 
				have been playing simulated games with serves lately. At first, I felt like most of my games were lost due to double faults and slow and poorly 
				placed serves. My only real chance of winning a game was on my coach's serve, depending on my return and cross-court forehand passing shots. 
				However, as I practiced more and more, I started to get better serves in, and now I am consistently winning my serve games.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left bigText-left">Going swimming</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left bigText-left">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-left bigText-left">I have had a passion for swimming ever since I was 5, when my parents introduced me to a friend of theirs, who was a swimming coach. 
				I started going swimming twice a week, and I learnt the basics of controlling my body in water, breathing correctly, as well as the crawl and breaststroke 
				techniques.</p>
				<p class="text-left bigText-left">At some point, I stopped having swimming lessons and started going swimming with my dad. We have been going swimming together for 
				several years now. Going swimming once a week with my dad is a great way for me to maintain my physical form, as well as to spend some quality time 
				with my father.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Swimming Challenges</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">This year, I have been going swimming with my dad for two hours each week. We go to a 25m pool in the Sportna Palata in Sofia. 
				Throughout the year, I developed my own swimming plan, aimed at improving my stamina and technique. My goal has been to gradually 
				increase the number of laps I swim each time, so that I could seamlessly become more durable.</p>
				<p class="text-right">For the most part, my plan consists of a mixture of the crawl, breaststroke, butterfly, and backstroke techniques. At first, 
				I used to swim 10 laps each, for a total of 40 laps or a kilometer. I found it hard to keep going after that, but I have been making sure to always 
				try and swim a couple laps more, to see how far I could push myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Nowadays, I am easily able to swim 20 laps of each technique, for a total of 80 laps or 2 kilometers. Keeping in mind that 
				we sometimes swim for 2 hours at a time, I am quite happy with my progress and current results. I have noticed that I take shorter and less 
				frequent breaks, and that my limiting factor has become the time we spend there, rather than the energy I have left. </p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Riding a Bike</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">Every day except in winter</h4>
				<p class="text-left">I live close to ACS. This is why, ever since my Prep year, I have been going to school by bike whenever the weather allowed it. 
				This activity has provided me not only with an eco-friendly means of transportation, but also a natural way to exercise and stay energized the whole day.</p>
				<p class="text-left">It is great that there are bike parking railings at ACS. I can lock my bike near Abbott without having to worry about it getting stolen.</p>
				<p class="text-left">A great perk of going to school by bike is that I can easily meet with friends in the neighborhood right away, instead of having 
				to go home to take my bike. Often times, I make arrangements with my friends to go see a movie or go ride bikes in the alleys of the Business Park. 
				This is why, in a sense, riding a bike to school has boosted my social life in a healthy way.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Going hiking with my Family</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">My mother and father have this tradition of going for a walk in Vitosha each Sunday. They explore different routes each time. 
				This year, I decided to join them on their Sunday mountain routine, even though walking long distances is not something I necessarily love.</p>
				<p class="text-right">At the beginning, it was hard for me to walk the same distance my family had been used to walk. I felt tired halfway through 
				the trek, and I thought it was funny how a young and trained person like me would tire more quickly than people my parents' age.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Even though I felt tired, my legs hurt, and my breathing was heavy, I endured and kept going with my family on their weekly 
				hikes. Now, I feel like I am able to finish all treks without really feeling exhausted. I am really proud of my progress, since now I am finally 
				able to keep up with my sporty parents.</p>
