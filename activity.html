				<h2>Activity Section Reflection</h2>
				<p class="sectionReflection">My major physical activities this year have been playing tennis, going swimming, riding a bike, and going on walks in the mountain. 
				While I primarily focus on those in my portfolio entries below, I have been doing a bunch of other physical activities, such as creating and following a home 
				fitness plan, walking my dog and playing with her in the backyard, and helping my family during the winter preparation at our villa.</p>
				<p class="sectionReflection">My first long-term physical activity has been playing tennis. I have been having 2-hour training sessions twice a week with a 
				personal coach. Throughout the year, we have come to a routine that we more or less follow every time. We start of with light hits from the middle of thr court 
				to warm up for the rest of the session. Then, we continue with stronger shots from the backline, in preparation for the upcoming 1v1 match. After that, I practice 
				volleys, smashes, and serves. With all the main hits out of the way, we start a 1v1 match. At first we played 10-point games with no serves, but as I got better and better at serving, I 
				told my coach I wanted to try playing a real match. Overall, I think I have improved massive over the course of the year, especially when it comes to serving and 
				making momentary decisions while playing.</p>
				<p class="sectionReflection">My second long-term physical activity has been going swimming with my father. Similar to the way I developed a routine when playing tennis, 
				I also developed one for my swimming sessions. At first, I would swim 10 laps of crawl, breaststroke, butterfly, and backstroke each. I decided to challenge myself and 
				to try to swim a bit more each time. As the year went by, I noticed I could easily swim 50-60 laps total. Now, I am able to swim 80 laps in total, 20 of each of the 4 
				swimming techniques. I am really happy with my progress, since I have achieved my goal of imporving bit by bit every time, and I have increased my overall stamina and 
				endurance, the effects of which were noticeable while doing other activities, such as playing tennis or riding a bike.</p>
				<p class="sectionReflection">My third physical activity have been riding my bike. Going to schook by bike has worked wonders for me, since I have not only been able to 
				stay fit, but it has also allowed me to be more flexible when making plans to go out with my friends. Going riding bikes with my friends is a fun way to socialize, 
				and it also a faster means of reaching our destinations, which has allowed me to go to the cinema or out in the parks more often.</p>
				<p class="sectionReflection">My final physical activity this year has been going on walks in the mountain with my family. This was an especially hard activity to get 
				into for me, since I get easily get tired from walking long distances. Even still, I agreed to join my parents on their weekly Sunday walk in Vitosha mountain. As I 
				walked more and more, my overall stamina and endurance seemed to improve, and now I am able to walk all the way and still feel pretty fresh.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Tennis Court Training</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">Twice a week</h4>
				<p class="text-left">I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old. I started training at DEMA Tennis Club in Sofia. At first, I trained in a beginner 
				group with 4 or 5 other kids. I learnt how to hold the racket, perform the basic hits properly, and move around the field.</p>
				<p class="text-left">As I got better, I started training individually with a personal trainer. Not only did I get to play more, compared to training 
				in a group, when I had to wait for my turn to hit the ball, but I also received more feedback, allowing me to improve quicker. Additionally, when 
				training, my coach and I simulate a real game, which is always fun, but I also get all my small mistakes pointed out at once. I have learnt more 
				advanced hits, such as slices and backline smashes, and I have also improved my serve and my all-around movement and decision-making.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Tennis Court Serving</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">Twice a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">Serving is something that I have always struggled with. Before, whenever I trained and played games with my coach, we would 
				always simulate a match without the serves. Of course, this was easier for me, since I didn't have to worry about scoring a good serve or defending 
				against my coach's serve. However, this was actually a major drawback, and it hurt my game substantially.</p>
				<p class="text-right">This is why I decided to focus on my serving this year. Every week, I would practice serving for 30 minutes at the end of each 
				training session. My coach would guide me, correcting my grip, movement, ball toss, and timing. I found this really helpful, and in no time, I was 
				able now to perform relatively good serves.</p>
				<p class="text-right">As I am somewhat confident enough in my serving abilities, I am putting them to the test each time I train. My coach and I 
				have been playing simulated games with serves lately. At first, I felt like most of my games were lost due to double faults and slow and poorly 
				placed serves. My only real chance of winning a game was on my coach's serve, depending on my return and cross-court forehand passing shots. 
				However, as I practiced more and more, I started to get better serves in, and now I am consistently winning my serve games.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left bigText-left">Going swimming</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left bigText-left">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-left bigText-left">I have had a passion for swimming ever since I was 5, when my parents introduced me to a friend of theirs, who was a swimming coach. 
				I started going swimming twice a week, and I learnt the basics of controlling my body in water, breathing correctly, as well as the crawl and breaststroke 
				techniques.</p>
				<p class="text-left bigText-left">At some point, I stopped having swimming lessons and started going swimming with my dad. We have been going swimming together for 
				several years now. Going swimming once a week with my dad is a great way for me to maintain my physical form, as well as to spend some quality time 
				with my father.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Swimming Challenges</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">This year, I have been going swimming with my dad for two hours each week. We go to a 25m pool in the Sportna Palata in Sofia. 
				Throughout the year, I developed my own swimming plan, aimed at improving my stamina and technique. My goal has been to gradually 
				increase the number of laps I swim each time, so that I could seamlessly become more durable.</p>
				<p class="text-right">For the most part, my plan consists of a mixture of the crawl, breaststroke, butterfly, and backstroke techniques. At first, 
				I used to swim 10 laps each, for a total of 40 laps or a kilometer. I found it hard to keep going after that, but I have been making sure to always 
				try and swim a couple laps more, to see how far I could push myself.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Nowadays, I am easily able to swim 20 laps of each technique, for a total of 80 laps or 2 kilometers. Keeping in mind that 
				we sometimes swim for 2 hours at a time, I am quite happy with my progress and current results. I have noticed that I take shorter and less 
				frequent breaks, and that my limiting factor has become the time we spend there, rather than the energy I have left. </p>

				<h3 class="text-left">Riding a Bike</h3>
				<h4 class="text-left ">Every day except in winter</h4>
				<p class="text-left">I live close to ACS. This is why, ever since my Prep year, I have been going to school by bike whenever the weather allowed it. 
				This activity has provided me not only with an eco-friendly means of transportation, but also a natural way to exercise and stay energized the whole day.</p>
				<p class="text-left">It is great that there are bike parking railings at ACS. I can lock my bike near Abbott without having to worry about it getting stolen.</p>
				<p class="text-left">A great perk of going to school by bike is that I can easily meet with friends in the neighborhood right away, instead of having 
				to go home to take my bike. Often times, I make arrangements with my friends to go see a movie or go ride bikes in the alleys of the Business Park. 
				This is why, in a sense, riding a bike to school has boosted my social life in a healthy way.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">Going hiking with my Family</h3>
				<h4 class="text-right ">Once a week</h4>
				<p class="text-right">My mother and father have this tradition of going for a walk in Vitosha each Sunday. They explore different routes each time. 
				This year, I decided to join them on their Sunday mountain routine, even though walking long distances is not something I necessarily love.</p>
				<p class="text-right">At the beginning, it was hard for me to walk the same distance my family had been used to walk. I felt tired halfway through 
				the trek, and I thought it was funny how a young and trained person like me would tire more quickly than people my parents' age.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Even though I felt tired, my legs hurt, and my breathing was heavy, I endured and kept going with my family on their weekly 
				hikes. Now, I feel like I am able to finish all treks without really feeling exhausted. I am really proud of my progress, since now I am finally 
				able to keep up with my sporty parents.</p>
